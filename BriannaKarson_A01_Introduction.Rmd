## 1) Concept and Discussion Questions
Enter answers to the questions just below the >Answer: prompt.

1. What are your previous experiences with data analytics, R, and Git? Include both formal and informal training.

> Answer: 
__R experience:__ In undergrad, I took a Biometry class that served as an intro to R, modeling, and data analytics. For my final project, I remember using a model to assess coral reef survey data. The following year, I completed a (year-long) independent thesis project where I meta-analyzed case study data using R. 
__Data analytics experience:__ Aside from the above, I have done some minor data analytics in my managerial role at Avasol, a reef-safe, organic sunscreen company. I use excel to analyze sales and inventory data for trends each year. I also am currently a Research Assistant in the Ocean Synthesis Lab, where I have been learning how to do thematic coding and qualitative analyses. I also have 2 courses worth of GIS experience under my belt (will be 4 by the end of the semester) if that counts as data analytics!  
__Git:__ None! It has been the most confusing part of the class so far. 

2. Are there any components of the course about which you feel confident?

> Answer: By the time I finished undergrad I felt pretty confident in my R skills, but it's been a 5 years since then, with basically no practice since. 

3. Are there any components of the course about which you feel apprehensive?
